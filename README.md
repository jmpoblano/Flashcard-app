# Flashcard-app
This is a flashcard application. This project is intened to run alongside a school web page, that helps students study subjects by allowing them to create, edit, 
and study their own digital flashcards. This ahs been the largest project i have completed yet, consisting of multiple folders and files. 

# Program
To create this, I utlized React, JSX, and Boostrap 4. I built the program locally with Visual Studio Code. Throughout the development process, I used node.js and hosted it locally to run my tests. The project took a total of 20 hours, from start code, through developing, and deployment. 

# Future uses
I would like to add some more functionality, like sign in functions so that multiple students can have their own. I would like to also include more functinos, like a way for the cards to get randomized when you begin studying. Also, including more stylized settings, like the ability to have different colors for the different flashcards you create.
